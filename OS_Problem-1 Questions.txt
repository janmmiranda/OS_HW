Problem 1:
Questions:
1. If root process A is terminated prematurely, by issuing kill, the children process will become orphans.
Then in this scenario by assigning the init process as the new parent to the orphan
processes. The init prcoess periodically invokes wait(), thereby allowing the exit status of any orphaned
process to be collected and releasing the orphan's process identifier and process-table entry.

2.You would probably get some kind of error, because getpid() gets the
process identifier of the calling process, where as getppid() gets the process identifier
of the parent process of the calling process.
