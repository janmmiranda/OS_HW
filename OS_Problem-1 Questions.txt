Problem 1:
Questions:
1. If root process A is terminated prematurely, by issuing kill, the children process will become orphans.
Then in this scenario by assigning the init process as the new parent to the orphan
processes. The init prcoess periodically invokes wait(), thereby allowing the exit status of any orphaned
process to be collected and releasing the orphan's process identifier and process-table entry.

2.If you display the process tree with root getpid() instead of pid() you will
get the process id of the root, the other prcoesses that appear in the tree
are the children processes because calling getpid() on those process will also retrieve
the process id for those processes.
