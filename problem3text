1. When comparing sleep and signal, we must consider their restrictions. In sleep, the restriction is based on time it takes for the process to end.
However, in signal, once the program has received the signal, the execution happens immediately. It is based on what the user wants when considering
which one to use.


2. Before the parent process dies, parent process responsibililty the 'wait_for_children()' function checks that all children have died or done their task. 
This is to avoid making any its child process a zombi by handling wait_for_children() function. If the function 'wait_for_children()' didn't handle then parent process dies but the child process runs as a zombie and thus unnecessarily uses resources.
